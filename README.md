# Octopus Data Structure

The Octopus data structure is an optimized hierarchical data structure that allows for fast lookups, hierarchical hashing, and efficient problem-solving using divide and conquer. It is ideal for handling large datasets and efficiently managing paths within them.

## Features:
- **Insertion**: Add data at specific paths.
- **Deletion**: Remove data at specific paths.
- **Lookup**: Quickly find data using root or intermediate hashes.
- **Pathfinding**: Find the path to specific data.
- **Batch Operations**: Perform multiple insertions or deletions in one operation.
- **Subtree Extraction**: Extract subtrees for analysis.
- **Hash Validation**: Validate data integrity.

The **Octopus** data structure is ideal for applications requiring optimized hierarchical data access, cryptographic verification, and scalable performance.

## **Key Features**

- **Root-Centric Lookup**: Retrieve data from any leaf node directly using only the root hash, eliminating the need for full traversal.
- **Hierarchical Hashing**: Aggregated hashes at root and intermediate levels ensure fast lookups and data integrity verification.
- **Scalable Power-of-8 Design**:
  - Level 0: Root with 8 child nodes.
  - Level 1: 64 nodes.
  - Level 2: 512 nodes.
  - And so on, growing exponentially.
- **Optimized Operations**: Supports insertion, deletion, size determination, pathfinding, and divide-and-conquer problem-solving.
- **Divide and Conquer**: Efficiently solve computational problems by leveraging hierarchical subsets.

## **Advantages**

1. **Fast Lookups**: Access leaf data directly using hashes, outperforming traditional structures like binary trees and hash tables.
2. **Data Integrity**: Validate the entire structure with a single root hash, ideal for cryptographic applications.
3. **Efficient Pathfinding**: Quickly determine the location of any node using its hash.
4. **Scalability**: Handles large datasets efficiently, making it ideal for distributed systems or parallel processing.

## **Applications**

- **Database Indexing**: High-performance data indexing for large-scale systems.
- **Cryptographic Verification**: Use root hashes for secure and efficient data validation.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Solve hierarchical pathfinding problems with minimal overhead.
- **Distributed Storage**: Shard and store data with built-in consistency checks.
- **Parallel Processing**: Process independent subsets concurrently for maximum efficiency.
- **Game Development**: Manage object hierarchies and scene graphs with fast access and updates.

## **Performance Goals**

The Octopus data structure is being rigorously tested for:
- **Lookup Efficiency**: Outperforming hash tables, trees, and graphs in retrieving data.
- **Insertion and Deletion Speed**: Maintaining consistent performance even as the structure grows.
- **Pathfinding Accuracy**: Ensuring robust and reliable navigation within hierarchical datasets.
