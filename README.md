# Octopus Data Structure

The Octopus data structure is an optimized hierarchical data structure that allows for fast lookups, hierarchical hashing, and efficient problem-solving using divide and conquer. It is ideal for handling large datasets and efficiently managing paths within them.

## Features:
- **Insertion**: Add data at specific paths.
- **Deletion**: Remove data at specific paths.
- **Lookup**: Quickly find data using root or intermediate hashes.
- **Pathfinding**: Find the path to specific data.
- **Batch Operations**: Perform multiple insertions or deletions in one operation.
- **Subtree Extraction**: Extract subtrees for analysis.
- **Hash Validation**: Validate data integrity.

## Installation:
```bash
pip install Octopus
